# uottawa-courses-places-available
Script to automatically check for places available for classes at uOttawa. Made this since the 'Notify' feature of Rabaska never worked for me.

## Usage
Edit the variables in the bash script, and run it at intervals (e.g. with cron).

## To do:
- Customizable action on change detection
- More reliable change detection (currently does return some false positives)
